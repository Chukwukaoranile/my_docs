#Project Description
Assist Capacity Exchange Development

The Capacity Exchange (CapX) is a project developing a sociotechnical platform for peer-to-peer connection and knowledge sharing towards sustainable, community-based capacity-building within the Wikimedia Movement. It intends to deliver an interactive, online platform, backed by a database, which will allow wikimedians to: publish information about themselves, their affiliates, and informal groups; conduct searches and access information published by others; connect with peers for knowledge exchange. The platform is intended to be responsive, intuitive, and accessible to all wikimedia users.

Originally built upon the OERWorldMap, the new development phase (2023-2025) is currently migrating the pilot software from Java to Python, using the Django framework. Therefore, the code is being reworked and re-written to embody a new pilot.
Within this effort, the intern will assist the project software developer on tasks related to planned Django Apps and other functionalities, such as the login, profile and search systems.

This project is mentored by Andi In√°cio (Project Manager), Veronica Stocco (Software Developer), and Jan-Bart de Vreede (Advisory Committee member).

We strongly encourage the application of women, people of color, LGBTQIAP+, and/or Global Southerners . Being part of the wikimedia movement is an advantage perk.
