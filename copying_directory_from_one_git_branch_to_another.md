# How to copy git directory from master to  branch

To copy a Git directory from the master branch to another branch, you can follow these steps:

* Ensure you are currently on the branch where you want to copy the directory to. If you need to create a new branch, you can use the following command, replacing <branch_name> with the desired branch name:

	git checkout -b <branch_name>

* Use the checkout command with the master branch and the specific directory path you want to copy. This command will bring the files from the master branch into your current branch.

	git checkout master -- <directory_path>

At this point check if the directory is in the required branch

* Replace <directory_path> with the actual path to the directory you want to copy. For example, if you want to copy the src directory, you would use:

	git checkout master -- src


* After executing the command, Git will copy the specified directory and its contents from the master branch to your current branch.

### Please note that this process only copies the directory and its contents. If you want to merge the changes made in the copied directory on the master branch into your current branch, you will need to perform a separate merge operation.
