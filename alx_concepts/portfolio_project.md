# Portfolio project


# Last run!

Yes! the portfolio project of the Webstack specialization will be your last-major-project!

# Make your choice


You will have almost 4 weeks to develop your portfolio project - during this period you will be alone or by team - to create a fully functional web application.

Be before starting any coding, you will need to research and define the project.

This project is important:

Because it will end your pathway at Holberton
It’s summarize the entire Webstack specialization
The weight of this project is important in your overall score
You can be as creative as you want
And the most important: **You should be proud of it** - it will be THE project to show of during interview



# Solo or by team?

Good question right?

The first question you should ask yourself is: what I want to do?

Front-end app? back-end app? both? e-commerce website? cloud platform for videos streaming? or better: a learning platform?

Don’t be afraid to work in a team - “more resources” means bigger project - but also more soft-skills.

Working solo is also fine - just don’t think too big or find quick-win to achieve your project.

# No idea?

Be creative doesn’t mean “create a web application that will make the world a better place” - no - it means: do what you really want: it can be applying concept your learn during the curriculum - it can be exploring a new technology (VueJS, Angular, Go, Rails, etc.) - or make a clone of an existing platform (I was not joking about the learning platform or video streaming…)

Try to solve a problem or learn!

Also, a web application doesn’t only mean “Website”, it can also be just an API.

# Steps of this portfolio project
To end the Webstack curriculum, the portfolio project is split in 3 parts:

* The pitch
* The development
Ready? Go!
